## ✨ Features

### 📅 Calendar & Tasks
- **Weekly / monthly / daily views** — create, edit, and delete events with categories, colors, recurrence rules, reminders, and notes
- **To-do list** — tasks with priorities, categories, due dates, recurring schedules, and event linking
- **Link tasks to a class** — tag any task with a class schedule entry (shows a color-coded chip on the task row)
- **Hide events** — hide individual events from view; reveal them back semi-transparently anytime
- **Overlapping events** — when events start at the same time the shorter one is indented; same-duration events get a stable stagger so both are always visible
- **Recurring event edit scope** — clicking a repeating event asks whether to edit *this occurrence only* or *all events in the series*; choosing "all" reopens the full form pre-populated with the original recurrence config (type, days, end date) and the series start date so every occurrence is regenerated
- **Recurring event delete** — deleting a repeating event shows an in-app panel: *Delete this event only* or *Delete all in series*

### 🔵 Google Calendar
- Connect **multiple Google accounts** and toggle individual calendars on or off
- Events auto-refresh every 5 minutes; per-calendar color overrides stored locally
- Calendar visibility toggles and custom colors are never reset by background syncs
- **Signing in does not auto-connect Google Calendar** — that is a separate explicit step

### 🟠 Canvas LMS
- Connect with your Canvas API token + institution URL (no IT setup needed)
- **Canvas Calendar Feed (no token needed)** — paste your personal iCal feed URL (Canvas → Calendar → Calendar Feed) to pull assignment due dates and events without an API token; works for any public `.ics` subscription URL too; events appear in Canvas orange on the calendar
- **Assignments on the calendar** — due dates appear as all-day task markers alongside your own events
- **Per-course toggles** — enable/disable individual courses; updates apply instantly to the calendar
- **Courses tab** — appears automatically when Canvas is connected, showing:
  - Assignments grouped by course with animated progress bars
  - Due date badges — overdue, due soon, or upcoming
  - Submission status chips — Graded / Submitted / Missing
  - Grade display when scores are available
  - Mark assignments done independently of Canvas
  - One-click links to open assignments in Canvas
  - Filter: **Upcoming / All / Done**

### 📊 GPA / Grade Projection

A collapsible **GPA / Grades** card appears at the top of the Courses tab whenever Canvas is connected and at least one assignment has been graded.

- **Per-course letter grade and percentage** — computed from the sum of earned points divided by graded points possible (e.g. 87 / 100 → B+)
- **Grading scale** — A 93–100 = 4.0, A– 90–92 = 3.7, B+ 87–89 = 3.3, … F < 60 = 0.0
- **Credit hours** — editable per course (default 3), persisted to `localStorage` under `lv-gpa`
- **Credit-weighted projected GPA** — displayed prominently at the top of the expanded card
- **"What do I need?" helper** — enter a target percentage per course to see the required average score on remaining (ungraded) points
- Mobile-responsive stacked layout; matches the existing Courses tab visual style
- Empty state shown when no graded assignments exist yet

### 📆 Class Schedule *(no Canvas required)*
- Add recurring class meetings manually — days of week, time, room, semester dates
- Classes appear as color-coded repeating events on the calendar
- **Link to Canvas** — optionally connect a schedule entry to its matching Canvas course
- Fully independent of Canvas

### ☁️ Cloud Sync — Reliability & Manual Refresh
- **Atomic writes** — cloud sync POSTs now run all database writes (DELETEs and INSERTs) inside a single transaction. If anything fails mid-way the entire write is rolled back, so partial data wipes are impossible.
- **Manual Refresh button** — when signed in, a refresh icon appears next to your email in the sidebar (desktop) and in the account section of the Settings tab (mobile). Tap it to immediately pull the latest cloud state to your current device — useful when you've updated your data on another device and don't want to wait for the next auto-sync. The icon spins while the pull is in progress.

### 🔐 Sign In *(optional)*
- **Local-first by default** — events and tasks live in your browser's local storage, no account needed
- **Sign in with Google** to sync your identity across devices
- Google Calendar and Canvas connections are separate explicit opt-ins
- Sidebar shows your email and a sign-out button when logged in; a "Sign in to sync" link when not

### 📦 Import / Export
- **Export** all local events and tasks as a timestamped JSON file
- **Import** a previously-exported file to restore or transfer data to any browser or device
- Only local data is included — Google Calendar and Canvas data re-sync from the source

### 🪶 Corvus AI Assistant
- Chat-based assistant powered by [Groq](https://groq.com) (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`)
- Aware of your upcoming events, tasks, Canvas assignments, **and class schedule entries**
- **Distinguishes events from classes** — recurring class schedule entries are labeled `[CLASS]`; professor-posted Canvas events are `[CANVAS EVENT]`; user-created entries are `[EVENT]`. Corvus uses the correct term in every response.
- **Add events and tasks**, edit them, and mark things complete — all via natural language
- **Interactive mention cards** — when Corvus discusses existing events or tasks (e.g. "urgent deadlines", "week summary"), it shows tappable preview cards for each item; tap one to navigate directly to it
- Runs as a floating panel or a full-screen tab

### 🔍 Search
- Search across events, tasks, and Canvas assignments with scope and status filters
- Results grouped by type — Canvas assignments, tasks, and events in a split layout
- **Smart navigation** — clicking a search result jumps the calendar directly to that event's date/week, opens the preview, and keeps the calendar on that date when you close it
- **Due date labels** — smart relative labels (Today, Tomorrow, Overdue, etc.)
- **Recent searches** — last 5 queries stored locally; tap a chip to re-run; Clear button removes history
- **Date range filter** — collapsible From / To date pickers filter all result types simultaneously
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys move focus through results; Enter opens the highlighted item

### 📋 Tasks — Subtasks
- Add up to 20 subtasks to any to-do item in the Add/Edit modal
- Each subtask can be checked off individually — matches CoursesPanel done style with strikethrough
- Progress chip on the task row shows `X/Y steps`; click to expand the inline checklist

### 🎯 Focus Timer *(optional)*
- **Pomodoro-style timer** tied to your tasks — open it from the timer FAB (desktop) or the Settings tab (mobile)
- **Focus → break → repeat:** a short break after each focus session and a **long break every 4 sessions** (all lengths configurable)
- **Pick a task or Canvas assignment to focus on** — completed sessions accumulate focus time on it (`X focused so far`)
- **Configurable durations** — set Focus / Short / Long lengths; one click resets to the factory `25 / 5 / 15`, or save your own values as your personal default
- **Auto-start toggle** — off by default, so the timer pauses between phases and waits for you to press play; flip it on for hands-free cycles
- **Built-in help** — a lightbulb in the header toggles a short, dismissible note explaining the flow and whether phases auto-advance
- **Log to calendar** — optionally drop each finished focus session onto the calendar as a real, editable time-block (this is how tasks become *time-blocking*)
- **Full-screen "zen" mode** — a large glowing progress ring with a selectable ambient background: **Stars**, **Snow**, or a slow **Aurora** (Esc to exit)
- A gentle two-note chime + confetti celebrate each completed session (chime can be muted); reminders also fire via the existing notification + push pipeline
- Fully optional and self-contained — it adds one `localStorage` key (`lv-focus`) and never alters existing events or tasks

### 🟠 Canvas — Assignment Notifications
- When Canvas syncs and finds new assignments that weren't seen before, a toast fires in-app
- If the browser has notification permission, an OS-level `Notification` also appears
- First sync seeds the seen-IDs list silently (no false positives on setup)

### 🟠 Canvas — Bulk Mark Done
- "Select" button in the Courses header enters selection mode
- Tap any assignment row or its checkbox to add it to the selection
- Selected rows highlight with a color tint
- A sticky bottom bar shows the count and "Mark done" / "Cancel" buttons
- Only undone assignments are toggled — no double-toggle on already-done items

### 🔔 Browser Push Notifications
- Service worker (`/sw.js`) enables notifications even when the tab is closed or backgrounded
- On sign-in the app requests notification permission and registers a push subscription
- Reminder alerts (event/task reminders) are sent via push so they fire when the tab is not active
- iOS Safari requires the app to be added to the Home Screen (iOS 16.4+)

### 🎨 Event Recolor
- Right-click (desktop) or long-press 500 ms (mobile) any user-created calendar event to open a color picker
- Select from 10 preset swatches — change applies immediately and persists across sessions
- Google Calendar and Canvas events cannot be recolored

### 📆 Mini Month Navigator *(desktop / tablet)*
- Compact month grid in the sidebar for fast date jumping
- Click any day to navigate the main calendar to that week
- Current week is highlighted; today is marked with a blue dot
- Hidden on mobile (bottom nav leaves no sidebar space)

### 🚨 Error Boundary
- Every major panel is wrapped in a React error boundary
- Crashes show a friendly in-app recovery card instead of a blank screen
- Individual panels can fail independently — the rest of the app keeps working

### 🤖 Corvus — Rate Limit Feedback
- When Groq returns 429 (rate limited), the send button shows a 30-second countdown
- Input and button are disabled during the cooldown to prevent repeated hammering

### 🌦 Everything Else
- **Weather widget** — live temperature and rain forecast pulled from Open-Meteo
- **Dark / light mode** — toggle from the sidebar
- **Responsive design** — desktop (full sidebar), tablet (mini-sidebar with labels), mobile (bottom tab navigation)
- **Mobile To-Do tab** — stacked layout with To-Do / Canvas / Both toggle pills; shows priority tasks up top and Canvas assignments below
- **Mobile search** — full-screen tab (no overlay), query resets each time you enter the tab; desktop keeps the Ctrl+K popup
- **Mobile Settings tab** — exposes Google Calendar sync, Canvas connection, class schedule, sign-in, theme toggle, and import/export on mobile
- **Swipe-safe navigation** — horizontal swipes advance/retreat weeks without accidentally triggering event creation
- **100dvh layout** — dynamic viewport height keeps the bottom tab bar fully visible on real devices

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm install   # required before running tests (node_modules is not committed)
npm test      # run all unit tests once (vitest run)
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
```

Tests live in `src/lib/` alongside the modules they cover:
- `src/lib/recurrence.test.js` — `expandRecurring` and `expandRecurringTodo` pure logic
- `src/lib/ics.test.js` — ICS date parsing (`parseIcsDate`) and VEVENT extraction (`parseIcs`)

---

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The app works without any environment variables. Google Calendar sync, Canvas sync, and sign-in each require their own credentials below.

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
# Groq — required for Corvus AI
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

# Google OAuth — required for sign-in AND Google Calendar
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
# Only needed in production (defaults to localhost in dev)
# GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/google/callback

# Session secret — required for sign-in (any long random string)
# Generate one: openssl rand -hex 32
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# Neon PostgreSQL — required for sign-in and per-user token storage
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/dbname?sslmode=require

# Web Push / VAPID — required for background push notifications
# Generate keys: node -e "const wp=require('web-push'); console.log(wp.generateVAPIDKeys())"
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapid_public_key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_vapid_private_key
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your@email.com
```

### Database Setup

Run `schema.sql` against your Neon (or any PostgreSQL) database:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f schema.sql
```

This creates the following tables: `users`, `google_accounts`, `canvas_credentials`, and `push_subscriptions` (for Web Push), plus supporting indexes.

**If upgrading an existing install,** run only the new `push_subscriptions` block from the bottom of `schema.sql` in the Neon SQL Editor — all statements are `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so running the full file again is safe.

### Getting API Keys

<details>
<summary><b>Groq</b> (Corvus AI)</summary>

1. Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Create an API key — free tier is available

## 🗄 Data Storage

<div align="center">

| Data | Where |
|:---|:---|
| Events & tasks | Browser `localStorage` — no account needed |
| Event / calendar preferences | Browser `localStorage` |
| Search history | Browser `localStorage` (`lv-search-history`) |
| Focus timer settings & today's stats | Browser `localStorage` (`lv-focus`) |
| Canvas seen-IDs (notification diff) | Browser `localStorage` (`lv-canvas-seen-ids`) |
| GPA credit-hours per course | Browser `localStorage` (`lv-gpa`) |
| Google Calendar tokens | Neon DB, per user |
| Canvas credentials | Neon DB, per user |
| Push subscriptions | Neon DB, per user + device |
| User accounts | Neon DB — created on first sign-in |
| Session | httpOnly cookie `lv_session` (JWT, 30-day expiry) |

</div>

Google Calendar and Canvas data is never stored server-side long-term. Tokens are used to fetch on demand; results are held in React state and cached to `localStorage` for fast reloads.
